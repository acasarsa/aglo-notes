# Singly-linked-lists

### Objectives: 

* define singly linked list
* compare and contract with arrays

will create a class for sinlgy linked list and write some methods for it

### Definition: a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

#### Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

#### There is no index value to use, you have to work your way through the list to find things. But can be faster to iterate through than arrays

It's like a building with no elevator. where an array has an elevator. You can go to any specific floor if you know exactly where you want to go. In LL you must take the stairs and go next next etc
