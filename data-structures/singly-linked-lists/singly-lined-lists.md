# Singly-linked-lists

### Objectives: 

* define singly linked list
* compare and contract with arrays

will create a class for sinlgy linked list and write some methods for it

### Definition: a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.

#### Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

#### There is no index value to use, you have to work your way through the list to find things. But can be faster to iterate through than arrays

It's like a building with no elevator. where an array has an elevator. You can go to any specific floor if you know exactly where you want to go. In LL you must take the stairs and go next next etc. 

**!!can add to beginning of array without reindex all other elements which is a huge time saver!!** 

| **Lists** | Arrays |
| :--- | :--- |
| do not have indexes | indexed in order |
| connected via nodes with a next pointer | insertion and deletion can be expensive |
| random access is not allowed | can quickly be access at a specific index |
