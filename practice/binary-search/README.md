## Big O

- Olog(n) is basically O(1) REALLY good 

- we get this from the slowest possible case 

#### used for sorted array only

- takes 4 steps with a 16 length arr. 
- double size of array and we add 1 more step
- 2log(n) 
  - 2 to what power gives us n? 
  - 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16 
  - 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 32
