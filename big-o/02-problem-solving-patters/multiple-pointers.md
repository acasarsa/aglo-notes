# 01-Multiple Pointers

* creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or towards each other in middle based on a certain condition 
* very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity 
* you have an array or a string and you use two variables such as i or j 

### Example

* Write a function called sumZero which accepts a **sorted** array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
