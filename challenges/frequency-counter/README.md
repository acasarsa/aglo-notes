# Frequency Counter

* This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
* This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O\(N^2\) operations with arrays / strings
  * useful when you have multiple inputs and you need to compare them and see if they consist of 
  * useful when comparing 2+ inputs or frequency of certain things occurring
  * usually O\(n\) rather than O\(n^2\) 
    * similar values
    * anagrams of one another
    * if a value is contained inside another value any time you compare
